# MongoDB Aggregation: $in Operator with ObjectIds Issue
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator with `ObjectId`s in MongoDB aggregation pipelines. The issue arises when the `ObjectId`s are not properly formatted or when there is a mismatch in the data types.

## Problem Description
The provided code snippet shows an aggregation pipeline that uses the `$in` operator to filter documents based on their `_id`. However, if the `ObjectId`s provided to the `$in` operator are not valid or are not properly formatted (e.g., missing quotes, incorrect hex representation), then the query may not return expected results or might return empty array.  This can be particularly challenging to debug.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the `ObjectId`s are properly constructed and formatted before being passed into the aggregation pipeline.  This often involves using the `ObjectId` constructor or ensuring that data retrieved from other sources provides correctly formatted values. 

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up a MongoDB connection.
3. Create two collections based on the schema. (if necessary).
4. Insert test data.
5. Run the `bug.js` script. Observe the (incorrect) output.
6. Run the `bugSolution.js` script. Observe the correct output.
